title: Board Game Review
summary: In this project we analyze the Board Game Geek Reviews,ratings and 
         build a machine learning models which can predict ratings for a review.
         Inaddition to that using one of the models built a web application that 
         can take a review and predict the rating.

#### Abstract:

Understanding the sentences and interpreting them in a meaningful way is increasingly important with the current machine learning tools. In this project we try to predict the rating of a game review utilizing some of the models available 



#### Introduction:

BoardGameGeek (BGG) is an online forum for board gaming hobbyists and a game database that holds reviews, images and videos for over 101,000 different tabletop games, including European-style board games, wargames, and card games. In addition to the game database, the site allows users to rate games on a 1–10 scale and publishes a ranked list of board games

In this project we start analyzing the reviews for the different games from BoardGameGeek Data and train a model that can predict the rating based on a review. Once we trained different models available under sklearn, we will use a best fit model based on our resiults and use it for our web application when a user can enter and out model will predit the rating



#### Overview:

My process to do this follows a sequence of steps. I first started with reading the data into pandas dataframes. After 
that i removed some of the unnecessary data and keep the important data that will be helpful for further analysis. 
Then i started cleaning the data my removing all the unnecessary words which won't aide us in determining the ratings.

Finally once we cleanup the data, i used several machine learning models to determine the best fit for our requirement.
In every stage of this process i provided some additional details and also provided some visual way to interpret the 
results.

During this process i referred several documents and user guides to make it work with good run rime and decent results.
I incorporated all the credits and citations at the bottom in the References sections.

Let's begin with the actual process.


##### Import Libraries:
As a starting point first we will import all the required python modules


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import re
import itertools
import copy
import random 
import pickle
from collections import defaultdict,Counter
from sklearn.datasets import load_files
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from nltk.corpus import stopwords,words
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression ,LogisticRegression
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```

##### Read Data:
The below function will read the data from the respective folders. Here i loaded all the required files under a folder called data is stored within the current folder of this notebook.

After the function we utilized the function to load all the data into pandas dataframes and i printed the header for each dataframe to get a sense of the columns



```python

def read_data():
    raw_additional_df=pd.read_csv('data/games_detailed_info.csv',index_col=0)
    raw_reviews_df=pd.read_csv('data/bgg-15m-reviews.csv')
    raw_score_df=pd.read_csv('data/2020-08-19.csv')
    
    return raw_additional_df,raw_reviews_df,raw_score_df

raw_additional_df,raw_reviews_df,raw_score_df=read_data()

```


```python
raw_reviews_df.head()
```

##### Cleanup Data:

Below function is to remove some of the additional characters from the review. After that we we will apply this function to all the comments in the review. Additional we will split each review into separate words and store then under a new column comment_split.


```python
def cleanup_data(data):
    pattern1=re.compile("[!#$%&'()*+,\'\"-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~]")
    pattern2=re.compile("(<br\s*/><br\s*/>)|(\-)|(\/)")
    data=re.sub(pattern1, '', data) 
    #data=re.sub(pattern2, ' ', data).lower()
    return data

```


```python
reviews_df['comment']=reviews_df['comment'].apply(cleanup_data)
reviews_df['comment_split']=reviews_df['comment'].apply(lambda line:line.lower().split())
reviews_df.head()
```

##### Remove Unnecessary Words:

Based on a simple analysis of the words in the comments, we have huge data with lot of unnecessary words. THose words include common stop words defined in ntlk, numberic words, non english words and few additional words. ALong with these there are many words which were not available atleast in 5 reviews.

Removing all those words will improve the performance of the analysis as well as improve the results


```python
flatten = itertools.chain.from_iterable
complete_data=list(flatten(reviews_df['comment_split']))
complete_counter=Counter(complete_data)

sorted_words=dict(sorted(complete_counter.items(),key=lambda i:i[1],reverse=True))
stop_words=set(stopwords.words('english'))
additional_words=['game','games','play','player','players','get','would','also','get','got','played','playing']

for word in list(sorted_words):
    if sorted_words[word] <5 or word=='br' or word in stop_words or not word.isalpha() or  word in additional_words:
        del sorted_words[word]
        
required_words=list(sorted_words.keys())

print('Total words ',len(complete_data))
print('No of unique words',len(complete_counter))
print('No of required words',len(required_words))
```

    Total words  112674582
    No of unique words 899487
    No of required words 123392
    


```python
reviews_df['comment_split']=reviews_df['comment_split'].apply(lambda line:[word for word in line if word in sorted_words])
reviews_df['rating']=reviews_df['rating'].round()
reviews_df.head()

##### High Frequency Words:

The below word cloud shows the Words with highest frequency in the reviews after cleanup


```python

word_cloud = WordCloud(width=400, height=350,colormap='plasma',background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(sorted_words)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.imshow(word_cloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.title('Common Words', fontsize=20)
plt.show()

```


![png](./index_22_0.png)



```python
reviews_df['comment_joined']=reviews_df['comment_split'].apply(' '.join)
```

##### Save reviews data:

Finally we cleaned up the complete data and store the processed reviews data into a pickle file


```python
reviews_final=reviews_df[['comment_joined','rating']].copy()
with open('reviews_final.pkl', 'wb') as f_reviews:
    pickle.dump(reviews_final, f_reviews)
```

##### Split Data

We will split the data into training and test datasets each with 10% of the actual data


```python

random.seed(0)
temp=random.randint(0,100)
train_data_x,test_data_x,train_data_y,test_data_y=train_test_split(reviews_df['comment_joined'],reviews_df['rating'],train_size=0.1,test_size=0.1,random_state=temp)
```


```python
print('Train Data comments Shape : ',train_data_x.shape)
print('Test Data comments Shape : ',test_data_x.shape)
print('Train Data rating Shape : ',train_data_y.shape)
print('Test Data ratings Shape : ',test_data_y.shape)
```

    Train Data comments Shape :  (299502,)
    Test Data comments Shape :  (299503,)
    Train Data rating Shape :  (299502,)
    Test Data ratings Shape :  (299503,)

##### Models:

So far we did all the required cleanup for the given data. Now we will use the cleaned training data for training the models. In
this process i will use 4 different models. THe models are as below

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes
4. Random Forest Classifier

##### Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more  dependent and independent variables.  Linear regression model fits using the least squares approach

Linear regression can interpreted as below

Y=a0+a1*X1+a2*X2+a3*X3+.....


##### Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is a model where the relationship between the response and the variables is a Logarithmic in nature. Unlike Linear regression output which is continuous, Logistic regression output is more of discrete in nature.

Logistic regression can be interpreted as below

log p/(1-p)= b^(a0+a1*X1+a2*X2+a3*X3+.....)


##### Naive Bayes:

Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with naive independence assumption between the features. Naive Bayes classifier is highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.


Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability can be interpreted as below

p(C|X) = p(C) * p(X|C)/p(X)


##### Random Forest Classifier:

Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method for classification that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. By using random forests we can reduce the overfitting on the training data that is normally seen in an individual decision tree.

Random forests uses only certain features in the dataset to split for a decision tree rather than using all the features in creating the tree. 




```python
vector=TfidfVectorizer()
train_vector_x=vector.fit_transform(train_data_x)
test_vector_x=vector.transform(test_data_x)

with open('vocabulary.pkl', 'wb') as f_vectorizer:
    pickle.dump(vector.vocabulary_, f_vectorizer)

```

##### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a linear model with coefficients to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.


```python
lin_reg=LinearRegression(n_jobs=-1)
lin_reg.fit(train_vector_x,train_data_y)

lin_reg_train_model=lin_reg.predict(train_vector_x)

```


```python
accuracy_lin_train=accuracy_score(lin_reg_train_model.round(),train_data_y)

print('Linear Regression Train Accuracy',round(accuracy_lin_train*100,2))

lin_reg_test_model=lin_reg.predict(test_vector_x)
accuracy_lin_test=accuracy_score(lin_reg_test_model.round(),test_data_y)

print('Linear Regression Test Accuracy',round(accuracy_lin_test*100,2))

with open('lin_reg.pkl', 'wb') as f_lin_reg:
    pickle.dump(lin_reg, f_lin_reg)
```

    Linear Regression Train Accuracy 39.77
    Linear Regression Test Accuracy 26.85
    


```python

fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,8))

##### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a linear model for classification rather than regression. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function.


```python
log_reg=LogisticRegression(n_jobs=-1,verbose=3)

log_reg.fit(train_vector_x,train_data_y)

log_reg_model=log_reg.predict(train_vector_x)
accuracy_log_train=accuracy_score(log_reg_model.round(),train_data_y)


```


```python
log_reg_test_model=log_reg.predict(test_vector_x)
accuracy_log_test=accuracy_score(log_reg_test_model.round(),test_data_y)

print('Logarithmic Regression Train Accuracy',round(accuracy_log_train*100,2))
print('Logarithmic Regression Test Accuracy',round(accuracy_log_test*100,2))

```

    Logarithmic Regression Train Accuracy 37.35
    Logarithmic Regression Test Accuracy 31.94
    


```python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,8))

##### Logistic Regression with 1000 Iterations

This is same as the earlier Logistic Regression model except that here we set the max_ite parameter to 1000. This will improve the train the model better and we can see the improved results in accuracy score as well.


```python
log_reg=LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000,n_jobs=-1)

log_reg.fit(train_vector_x,train_data_y)

log_reg_model=log_reg.predict(train_vector_x)
accuracy_log_train=accuracy_score(log_reg_model.round(),train_data_y)


```


```python
log_reg_test_model=log_reg.predict(test_vector_x)
accuracy_log_test=accuracy_score(log_reg_test_model.round(),test_data_y)

print('Logarithmic Regression Train Accuracy (1000 iterations)',round(accuracy_log_train*100,2))
print('Logarithmic Regression Test Accuracy (1000 iterations)',round(accuracy_log_test*100,2))

with open('log_reg.pkl', 'wb') as f_log_reg:
    pickle.dump(log_reg, f_log_reg)
```

    Logarithmic Regression Train Accuracy (1000 iterations) 42.76
    Logarithmic Regression Test Accuracy (1000 iterations) 31.65
    


```python
fig,(ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,8))

##### Naive Bayes Model

In this project we use scikit's MultinomialNB to implement Naive Bayes. MultinomialNB implements the naive Bayes algorithm for multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes variants used in text classification (where the data are typically represented as word vector counts, although tf-idf vectors are also known to work well in practice). The distribution is parametrized by vectors 
 for each class , where  is the number of features (in text classification, the size of the vocabulary) and  is the probability of feature  appearing in a sample belonging to class 


```python
naive_bayes=MultinomialNB()
naive_bayes.fit(train_vector_x,train_data_y)
naive_bayes_model=naive_bayes.predict(train_vector_x)
accuracy_naive_train=accuracy_score(naive_bayes_model.round(),train_data_y)

print('Naive Bayes Train Accuracy ',round(accuracy_naive_train*100,2))
```

    Naive Bayes Train Accuracy  36.67
    


```python
naive_bayes_test_model=naive_bayes.predict(test_vector_x)
accuracy_naive_test=accuracy_score(naive_bayes_test_model.round(),test_data_y)

print('Naive Bayes Test Accuracy ',round(accuracy_naive_test*100,2))

with open('naive_bayes.pkl', 'wb') as f_naive_bayes:
    pickle.dump(naive_bayes, f_naive_bayes)
```

    Naive Bayes Test Accuracy  29.64

##### Random Forest Classifier:

A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.


```python
random_classifier=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100,verbose=3,n_jobs=-1,max_depth=5)
random_classifier.fit(train_vector_x,train_data_y)
random_classifier_train_model=random_classifier.predict(train_vector_x)
accuracy_random_classifier_train=accuracy_score(random_classifier_train_model.round(),train_data_y)
```

##### Random Forest Classifier with max depth 500:

In the earlier run i gave max_depth of 5. This value restricts the depth of the tree without which the tree will split till each leaf contains only min_samples_split samples. The default value for min_samples_split is 2 which means the tree will split in entirety but that will take huge amount of time.

So, in my earlier case a depth of 5 is restricting the forest creation and it is completing very quickly. Also the results are not great which can be see in both training and test accuracy. So, i tested for various depths and a depth of 500 gave much better results with a decent run time of 90 mins. 

Alternatively i tried with min_samples_split of 10 and that gave very similar results as max_depth of 500 but took more time. So, i am settling with max_depth of 500.


```python
random_classifier=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100,verbose=3,n_jobs=-1,max_depth=500)
random_classifier.fit(train_vector_x,train_data_y)
random_classifier_train_model=random_classifier.predict(train_vector_x)
accuracy_random_classifier_train=accuracy_score(random_classifier_train_model.round(),train_data_y)

The above result shows an excellent output on the Training data but it didn't perform similarly on the test data. This is primarily because of overfitting. A further increase on depth might improve the results but given the hardware constraints i will limit the maximum depth to 500.



```python
sample_review=['The movie is super','The movie is not worst','The movie is  excellent','The movie is  worst','I like this movie','i like this movie']
sample_review_vector_x=vector.transform(sample_review)

sample_predict_lin=lin_reg.predict(sample_review_vector_x)
sample_predict_log=log_reg.predict(sample_review_vector_x)
sample_predict_naive=naive_bayes.predict(sample_review_vector_x)
sample_predict_random_classifier=random_classifier.predict(sample_review_vector_x)
```

    Sample Review results for Linear Regression [7. 3. 8. 3. 7. 7.]
    Sample Review results for Logistic Regression [8. 1. 9. 1. 7. 7.]
    Sample Review results for Naive Bayes [8. 6. 8. 6. 8. 8.]
    Sample Review results for Random Classifier [8. 1. 8. 1. 8. 8.]
    

##### Conclusion:
  I started with doing Linear regression and then tried Logistic Regression. I see muxh improvement with Logistic regression. Then i tried Logistic regression with 1000 iterations and that showed decent results. Then i tried Naive Bayes. In Naive Bayes we can clearly see from the graphs that the results are distorted towards a particular value (specifically value 8). This is applicable for both train data and test data. Then i tried Random Forest Classifier. The results of this classifier is interesting. The train data showed much better accuracy compared to any other model. But test data results are not much better than logistic regression though it is better than Linear and Naive Bayes models. The Random Forest classifier results are more Overfitted with Training data. 
  
  Another interesting thing is Naive Bayes is the fastest model to built and Random Forest Classifier took very long time. Logistic regression is also faste but when we run it for 1000 iterations it took more time. Over all, based on the sample data results and model size logistic regression is the best algorithm  for my application. 
  

##### Contribution:

I built an application for the rating predictor based on the review. For this purpose i used flask on pythonanywhere. This application can take a review through an enterable form and can calculate the rating based on our model built above. Additionally for cleanup data i used some python inbuilt flattening the multidimensional arrays to quickly identify the low frequency and redundant words. This process reduced the run time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) which is very important for the large dataset.
    

##### Challenges:

Due to the sheer size of data it took good amount of time to cleanup the data. I utilized some of the functions i created in my Naive Bayes Classifier assignment for cleanup the data. Also when i started with RandomForestClassifier it took several hours but not result. Then i went through some documentation and understood the importance of no of jobs ,maximum depth and also verbose which can help in tracking the progress. I started with a maximum depth of 5 and increased it slowly based on results. But due the time taken and size of the model i stopped the maximum depth at 500. For a maximum depth of 500 with 4 parallel jobs it is taking 90 minutes. More than time the model built is of size 3.54 GB. So, even if we increase the maximum depth further to improve the results along with time, the model will increase in size which cannot be used in our flask app based on the size limitations of our webapp hosting site pythonanywhere.

I think given the capacity of the servers both size and processing power, RandomForestClassifier can give better results.
